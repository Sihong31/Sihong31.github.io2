    An important issue facing the world of tech is the ever growing amount of data that is being created and pushed onto the internet every day. As the planet's population growth and the standards of living of people around the world continue to get better, more and more people will be hopping on the computer and generating data. Tech executives have been worried about this for years and the amount of data will only grow increasingly larger with each coming year. Professionals in tech are afraid that there will not be enough qualified tech workers who know how to work with and manage this growing amount of data. There is also the worry that nobody really knows what will happen in the future, the technical and infrastructural implications are unclear. Some also believe that while data is growing exponentially, the increases in the power of computers has been decreasing. With the increasing amounts of data, it is also becoming harder to provide data security and protect privacy.

   Google, for example, received over 2 million search queries per minute in 2012. That number became over 4 million in 2014. Some other interesting facts include:
<ol>
   <li>Face users share 2.5 million pieces of content per minute.</li>
   <li>300,000 tweets come out of tweeters per minute.</li>
   <li>Youtubers upload 72 hours of video content per minute.</li>
   <li>Users download around 50k apps from apple per minute</li>
</ol>
   Now multiply all those numbers by 1440 minutes and you'll see how what happens in a day.

     I think that it is important to introduce elementary computer science classes to grade school kids in order for these kids to realize from an early age whether they are interested in tech or not. I feel that many students are never given the opportunity to really know what the tech industry is all about simply because they were not exposed to it in their education. That is a shame because of the loss of potential talent that is sorely needed, especially with the issues facing the tech industry today. I think that company should invest even more in research and development for powerful processors that can handle the mountains of data that is being created daily.
