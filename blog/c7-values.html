    When I'm feeling the happiest, the proudest, and the most satisfied, the following values come to mind: achievement, ambition, accomplishment, loyalty, freedom, confidence, inspiration, self-respect, and self-reliance. In general I definitely try to live up to these values to the best of my ability even when things seem to get hard. I think it is especially important to remember my values when I have a bad day and nothing seems to be going right. For example, if I am failing at multiple things in the same day and receive harsh criticism for it, it is important to take a step back and tell myself that I am a person of worth and I have the mental and physical stamina to pull through.

    I think that freedom is one of my most important values. I would hate to ever be caged like a bird and not be able to explore and learn new things at any time that I wanted. I want to be able to have the choice and mobility to learn as I please and move from place to place as I please. I think that this value helps me maintain a healthy mental state of mind.

    The very last topic someone asked my advice on actually had to do with a popular video game called League of Legends. The person had asked me what the skill build order and itemization was for a particular champion and I went through it with him step by step so that he could have the most enjoyable experience out of the game he was playing. I think that this is relevant to my value of freedom because even though I am very busy these couple of weeks with work and learning Javascript while at DBC, I still have the freedom to talk about or get involved with my side interests and hobbies. There is no brick wall that stops me from still playing around with what makes me happy and I feel that this is very important.

    I feel that I generally admire people who are self-confident, emotionally intelligent, hard working, and independent. These are the types of values that I like to have for myself also. I think that having these values will help pull me through any type of ordeal no matter what the stress level is or the amount of stereotype threat involved with it. At the end of the day, it's important to know that you are your own best friend and that no one will ever understand you better than yourself. So make sure that you treat yourself with respect and don't beat yourself up over something too harshly because you are the only one who will be there at the very end to pick yourself out of the mud and move on.  

    I think that physical exercise in general is a good way to reduce feelings of stress or pull yourself out of some minor depression. Yoga is probably is a good way to reduce stress levels. Taking a short break and doing something that interests you for 15 minutes to half an hour before going back to work can also be a good way to feel better. I feel like the pomodoro technique can be applied here if something regularly stresses you out, you should take a 5 minute break after every 25 minutes of working on something or being somewhere so that you don't get burnt out.
