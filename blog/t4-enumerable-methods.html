    Today I'm going to talk a bit about the enumerable group_by. According to ruby-doc group_by groups a collection by result of the block. It returns a hash where the keys are the result from the block after being evaluated. The values are arrays of elements from the collection that corrsepond to each key.

    Groups the collection by result of the block. Returns a hash where the keys are the evaluated result from the block and the values are arrays of elements in the collection that correspond to the key. An enumerator will be returned when no block is given.

    Example of numerator return: 

    <pre> (1..6).group_by {|i| i%2} #{1=>[1, 3, 5], 0=>[2, 4, 6]}</pre>

 



    </p>
</div>

<div id="div2">
    <p>

   Here an example of group_by in action by grouping the first letter in a name:

    <pre> names = ["Bob","George","Hal","John","Megan","Christina","Allie","David","Don","Carol"]

 grouped_names = names.group_by {|n| n[0]}

 #=> {"B"=>["Bob"], "G"=>["George"], "H"=>["Hal"], "J"=>["John"], "M"=>["Megan"], "C"=>["Christina", "Carol"], "A"=>["Allie"], "D"=>["David", "Don"]} </pre>

    As you can see the original array was grouped and returned as a hash according to the instructions of our code block {|n| n[0]} which said to look at the first character of each array element and return it as the key with the corresponding names as values.
       
    </p>
 </div>
 <div id="div3">
    <p>
    Here is an example using the same array, but grouping by the length of the names:

    <pre> names = ["Bob","George","Hal","John","Megan","Christina","Allie","David","Don","Carol"]
       
 length_group = names.group_by {|n| n.length}

 #=> {3=>["Bob", "Hal", "Don"], 6=>["George"], 4=>["John"], 5=>["Megan", "Allie", "David", "Carol"], 9=>["Christina"]} </pre>

    This example uses the same format as the previous example, but instead of telling the code block to look for the first character in each array element, it is looking for the length of each element in the array and then returning the length as the key and the names of each corresponding key as the values.
