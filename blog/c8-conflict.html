    I had a conflict involving a team project when I was still in college. There were five of us in a group and our deadline was quickly approaching, but nobody seemed to really take the project seriously because they felt that we could finish off everything at the very last minute. I didn't want to work overnight on the last minute for the project because there could be a high chance of messing up and not being able to account for things that we normally could have accounted for if we spent more time thinking about it.

    The source of the conflict mainly came from two members of the group who didn't really care about the project or the grades they would receive on it and they were perfectly content with ruining the grades of the remainder of the team.

    My emotions upon anaylzing the conflict were primarily confused and anger. I couldn't understand how people could be this selfish and uncaring of other people. I felt that these people had no sense of empathy at all.

    In the end, the three of us in the group that cared about the projecte ended up reporting the two students in our group that never showed up to our preliminary meetings and didn't contribute or communicate at all in email or online group meetings. We ended up just working on the project with the three of us and did well. However, we had much more work to do than other groups people because of our lack of members. 

    If I could go back in time, I feel that one of the things I would have done would be to reason with the two members who didn't show up more than I did back in the day. I feel that maybe The three of us remaining group members could've got them to actively participate more. Maybe something serious was happening in their lives that we didn't know about, but we didn't bother to ask exactly why they never interacted with us. We just saw them as lazy and uncaring towards our common goal. I think I could've spent more time thinking in their shoes.

    I learned from this experience that it's very important to be communicative and open with team members for any team project or else nobody will know what is going on inside your head. It's important to be proactive and talk to teammates that may be lagging behind or distracted and figure out the root of the problem so that everyone will feel better during a negative/awkward situation.
