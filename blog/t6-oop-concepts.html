    This week I got to learn some of the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Something central to OOP is the idea that data and the operations around this data are closely related to each other. OOP's main activity is to create new objects and can be used to add additional methods to existing objects. So far in my programming journey, I've worked only with OOP languages so researching a bit about FP will give me a better understanding of what that is. </p>

    <p>After doing some research on Functional Programming (FP), it appears that data in FP is only loosely relaed to its functions. It allows you to write different operations on the same data structure. FP's main activity is to write new functions.</p>

    <p>Compared to OOP, the central model for abstraction in FP is the function and not the data structure.

     OO makes it easy to change the way things are put together while it makes it harder for adding new operations. For example, if you already have a certain process in place, but want to change the way in which that process takes in certain rules then you would use OO to handle this. </p>

     <p>FP will make it easier to handle new operations that work with existing data types and queries because it is more database oriented.

     OO languages are good for code evolution where new things can be added to a set of operations on things that were already created. For example, adding new classes to work with existing methods.</p>

     <p>FP languages are good for adding new operations on things that already exist. For example adding new functions that work with existing data types. I think that overall both OO and FP have their uses in code and software and a combination of both should be used in order to run things efficiently for whatever purpose that the software may be used for.
