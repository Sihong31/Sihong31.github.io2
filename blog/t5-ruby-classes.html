    This week, I learned about Ruby classes and would like to share an example class that I covered and offer the explanation and reasoning behind it. The class that I created involved rolling a die that takes an array of strings as the input and outputs the number of sides of the die and also returns a random string from the die when called.

       <pre>
  class Die
    def initialize(sides)
      if sides.length == 0 #using length to find number of elements in array
        raise ArgumentError.new("Hey, your input array can't have 0 elements!")
      else
        @sides = sides
      end
     end 
    </pre>

  In the above code if the number of elements in the array called sides equals to zero then an ArgumentError would be raised stating that the input array can not have 0 elements. For all other arrays that are inputted, the instance variable @sides = sides. 
    </p>
</div>

<div id="div2">
    <p>
    The difference between an instance variable @sides and a local variable sides is that @sides is bound to the instance of a class and covers its scope, while a local variable is bound to the method where it is defined.

    <pre>
    def sides
      @sides.length #counts number of elements in array.
    end
    </pre>

    In this part of the code we see the method sides created. It takes the instance variable @sides and calls the method length on it. This counts the number of elements in the array.

       
    </p>
 </div>
 <div id="div3">
    <p><pre>
    def roll
      @sides.sample #sample returns a random string from the array.
    end
  end
    </pre>
  In the last piece of the class we see that the method sample is being called on the instance variable @sides. This returns a random string element from the original input.
