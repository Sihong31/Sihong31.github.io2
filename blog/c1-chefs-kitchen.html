     From what I’ve seen from the Fireside Chat video my take is that the DBC experience is very hands on and interactive. It is very important to roll up my sleeves and get into the coding from day 1. I need to tell myself that these are MY 9 weeks. I think that DBC is a very creative, collaborative, and helping environment. I think that while students should all come in believing that the 9 weeks belong to them, they should also help each other evolve during the program whenever possible. I plan on doing the same because I know that we are all in this together and I want to make the best of it.

      My expectations of DBC have not changed since watching the video and I am definitely excited to finish my phase 0 and move onto the immersive portion of the program. It definitely makes me nervous to be part of this program because I feel like a noob fish out of water, but I am determined to see it through. The thought that about 5% of participants in DBC will leave the program is a bit intimidating. The thought of falling behind is a big scary, but it makes me feel comfortable to know that the environment is friendly and collaboratively rather than competitive and people are willing to help each other pull through.

      I liked the analogy of walking from San Francisco to Seattle with some people at 5 steps and some people at 100 steps because it makes me realize that we all have a long journey ahead and much more to learn together. “This is soccer, not tennis.”
