  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

    I feel living in the US as a minority will always entail at least a little bit of a stereotype threat. Some minorities face this threat in larger amounts, but we all face it nevertheless. I feel that the most important thing with this is to not let it get to my head. Living in a country where I'll always be the a minority (at least during my life time) has its pros and cons. There are definitely steretypes out there from when I was still in high school that all asians are good at math, follow the rules, and are very quiet and conservative. I feel that these stereotype have mostly remained the same, but maybe viewed as less so because asians have assimilated more into American culture with each generation.

    I like to place steretypes into two categories. To me there are "good" stereotypes and "bad" stereotypes, but neither is really beneficial nor harmful to me personally. The idea that all asians are good at math is what I would call a "good" stereotype because it has some positive aspects to it. Personally, I have never been the first place student in school for math so it feels awkward to me that this label exists, It makes me feel like I am trying to achieve a personal goal that I never actually set for myself.  

    The stereotype that all asians are quiet is what I consider to be a "bad" stereotype because to me it means that asians don't like to participate in any activities or won't stand up for what they believe in and just let others do all the work. This is definitely not true because I know plenty of asians who are very vocal and expressive. However, I happen to actually be one of the quieter ones. This doesn't mean that we're all like that, it is more of a individual personality trait than a minority trait.

    I believe that stereotype threat can be very dangerous to minorities as well as the hiring company if it has certain pre-determined ideas of what various groups of minorities should act like and then those ideas are somehow not met or different from what was expected. I think it's important to set aside this idea of stereotype and view people as individuals rather than as some category or group. So far in my life, I can't say that I faced any serious stereotype threats as the people that I have run across are generally opened minded and I would like it to stay that way.
