    There are many different options available in CSS that can change the way a section of your HTML can look. Three of these include margins, borders, and padding. Imagine that you have content within a square box on a webpage. The margin is the area outside of this box relative to the edges of the webpage or the edges of whatever is emcompassing the box (maybe there is a bigger box surrounding it). Making the margin bigger will give you more space between the borders of your box and the edges of whatever is emcompassing your box. For example, giving the box a margin of 20px will provide more space in between than 10px will (e.g., "margin:20px;" or "margin-top:10px;") .

       Border is exactly what it sounds like. It is the border around your box. You can change your border in a variety of ways including the size of the border, the color of the border, and the style of the border such as solid or dashed lines (e.g., "border:1px solid #3964C3;"). I think that borders are a nice way to make the box unique and stand out.

       Padding is essentially the space between the content of  your box and its border. A padding of 20px gives you more space between your content and border than a padding of 10px (e.g., "padding:20px;" or "padding:10px;". Padding is nice when you feel that your content within an element's border looks too cramped together and you would like to see more space in between.
