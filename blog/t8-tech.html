    I have been using the internet since my childhood days and I couldn't imagine living without it, especially in today's highly connected world. The internet is supported by two key components known as hardware and protocols. Some examples of hardware include routers, servers, cell phone towers, satellites, and smartphones. A "network" is created when these devices are put together. 

    Servers are generally machines that store information that we are trying to access on the Internet. Nodes serve the purpose of connecting points of traffic online. 

    Protocols are exactly what the word sounds like. They are rules that the machines accessing or connected to the internet must follow. These protocols are used so that different machines would be able to understand each other, in a common language, and pass information alng on the internet.

    The http in front of URLS in web browsers stand for hypertext transfer protocol and is one such protocol that machines follow in order to relay and pass information and stay connected. 

    Two very important protocols are known as the TCP and the IP, transmission control protocol and internet protocol, respectively. These protocols establish various rules on how information should be passed on the internet. These protocols allow you to acesss information on the internet without needing a direct connection. IP addresses, for example, is how machines would find each other on the internet. 

    The TCP/IP protocols are what makes sending and retrieving information from another computer possible. DNS or domain name servers points your requests for information in the right direction and once your target server receives your request it'll send a response back to your machine.

    When you receive a response back you'll get it in a series of packets. Packets are parts of a file that range from 1,000 to 1,500 bytes. These packets tell computers or other devices the information it contains and how it fits with other packets in order to see an entire file. Packets can travel from mutliple paths, most likely ones with the least resistance. 

    This is what happens when you are looking at content on a webpage or reading your emails. Video conversations are convereted into packets through what is called the VoIP or voice over internet protocol. There is definitely much more to see and learn from how the internet works and I have been able to provide a basic outline from what I have learned doing some online research on the subject.
