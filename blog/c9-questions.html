    I felt that the questions I asked the Google+ community were average in terms of how much I got out of them and how much other people could get out of them. Most of the questions that I asked were simply about errors I was getting when setting up my computer environment or some simple syntax errors that I couldn't figure out while working with Ruby. I felt that I could've asked better questions during these 9 weeks on Google+ community, but I mostly referred to stack overflow and researched/asked questions directly on that site.

   I think that most questions that do not get answered on the Google+ community are those that ask for a very specific answer and does not benefit anyone else in the community. I feel that these types of questions are the most common because of the very different issues that people run into while learning to program. The answers to these problems may help one or two people who run into them, but that's about it. There are also those questions which were very vague or ambiguous and people didn't know how to answer because they weren't sure what the poster's thought process was. 

   I think that it is important to be as clear as possible and state exactly what you are looking for as well as provide code and driver test results as examples.

     From what I have seen through my research and my own experiences, good questions are those that not only benefit the person who asked the question, but also a wider group of people. These questions with their relevant answers serve as a guidebook for future students to look at who may have similar or exactly the same problems in their programming journey. The best questions are those that clearly ask for something and can be answered in a number of ways so that people can see different approaches to a difficult question and not have to be tunnel visioned into thinking that there is only one way or one solution in doing something because in most cases that is never true. Good questions are those that allow for flexible answers and many different ways of thinking and solving. 

    I feel that good questions are those that stay relevant over the years and help thousands of people solve their issues and provide enligtenment to an array of issues that someone may be having.
