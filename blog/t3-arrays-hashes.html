    This week I learned a bit about the programming language Ruby and I would like to share what understanding of the differences between arrays and hashes and when I would choose to use one over another.

       <p>Example of an array:

    <pre>ary = [1, "two", 3.0] #=> [1, "two", 3.0]</pre></p>

    <p>Example of a hash:

    <pre>
        books         = {}
        books[:matz]  = "The Ruby Language"
        books[:black] = "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" </pre></p>

    </p>

    </p>

    Arrays are basically ordered indexes that start at 0 and contain an element in each ordered index. Negative indexes also exist, but will count from the last element you have in the array.

    Hashes are collections of key-value pairs. Hashes do not contain the same time of ordered indexes the way arrays do. You can name the indexes, which are called keys in hashes, anything you want. In short, hashes point an object to another object.

    Hashes are generally thought to be more convenient to use than arrays. Hashes can be used for the purposes of storing multiple arrays at the same time. It can be used when you want to create some quick data and have a easier time remembering "pet" rather than element 0. An issue with hashes is that the data is not ordered so it could be difficult to find your way around if there is too much information in a hash. However, it would be easy to sift through information with something like the orderly array.
