       My Gregorc thinking style is concrete sequential. This means that I like order, logical sequences, predictability, and getting the facts. I like having a very structured environment where I can rely on others to help complete tasks. It's hard for me to work in groups when it seems that the work is not being done and everything appears unorganized.

          I feel that my thinking style is good for learning new materials in a very step by step and orderly way. I'll be able to built off of what I learned previously and not face confusion in future steps because I followed the previous steps precisely to get to where I am. I feel that my learning style works well with programming code because I would want my code to be finished step by step in an orderly fashion and would be easy to read because of how organized it would be. I feel that it would not be easy for me to get lost while working on a challenge or project because I have already made defined paths for myself on what I should be accomplishing.

        I feel that one of my biggest struggles during these three weeks is becoming pigeonholed into a position where I start thinking too much into the details of a challenge. I would have to step back and take a break before continuing to work and realizing that the problem can be resolved with a simple solution rather than 7 lines of code. I feel that while my thinking style has its own advantages, it's also important  outside the box of what I am doing and try to see if there is a easier way to accomplish the same goal. I plan on constantly reminding myself about this as I progress through phase 0 of DBC. In order to become a well-rounded learner it is important to recognize how other thinking styles find solutions to problems. One way to do this is to read other people's reflections and blogs and obtain insight on this.
