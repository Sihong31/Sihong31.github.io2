      So this is my first week of phase 0 and so far it has been a blast. The challenges have been “challenging” to say the least and has taken much of my brain power to figure out. There are many coding commands and steps taken through them that I have to memorize. And being the programming noob that I am, I had to go back numerous times to get my work in order.  So in this blog I am writing about version control and git through my own understanding of what they are.

      Version Control:
      Using version control comes with many benefits. Using a version control system allows different programmers from all over the world to work on the same code without having to worry about overwriting others’ hard work. Version control gives programmers the flexibility to save their work anytime they feel like it is necessary so that if they make a mistake in the future they can quickly revert back to a safe file.  Version control can also act as a remote back-up in case something happens to your main computer or servers.

      Git keeps a “git log” of all the changes that you have made so that you can easily go through them and see various modifications, creations, or deletions, that were made. Github is widely used and is a great way to store and share code with others. Storing code on github can lead to self improvement when others offer constructive criticism of your code.
