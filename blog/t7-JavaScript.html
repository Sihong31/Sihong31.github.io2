    After working with Ruby for the last four weeks, it's been nice to have a change of scenery and get a basic look at what JS is like. I have noticed many similarities between the two and yet there is unfamiliar syntax and logic in some instances.  JS uses functions while Ruby uses methods and they work the same way. The syntax is a bit different. 

    In Ruby:
    <pre> def cookies
      puts "I like cookies"
 end</pre>
    
    In JS:
    <pre> function cookies() {
      console.log("I like cookies");
 } </pre>

     I definitely get a feeling that it takes a few more steps in order to achieve the same result in JS than it does in Ruby just from the syntax of the examples I used above.

     Some differences between Ruby and JS include the following:

     Both Ruby and JS have arrays. In JS, objects act the same way as Ruby hashes with a property (key) and a value (value). Both languages are object oriented which means that their objects can be easily associated to their methods or functions.

     I noticed that JS is more flexible in terms of converting something into a typeof and passing it even though the forced conversion sometimes yields undesired results.

     Ruby has block level scoping for local variables while Javascript has function level sopcing for local variables. 

     Ruby programs run slower while JS programs run faster.

     Ruby uses classes while JS uses protoypes whose functionality is similar to a Ruby class.

     JS uses the triple equal sign , === , to do the same thing as the double equal sign, == , in Ruby. Both helps determine if objects are exactly the same typeof and the same value. The double equal sign is used in JS to compare the value.

     Ruby is a server-side scripting language while Javascript is a client-side language. Ruby definitely has much easier syntax to understand than JS. 

     Errors will occur in Ruby when a method is called for an incorrect object while in JS methods can be used to change the values of a variable.

     Ruby has blocks, procs, lambdas while Javascript has function expressions and function declarations.
