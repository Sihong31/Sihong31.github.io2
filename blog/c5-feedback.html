    It's been a few weeks into DBC now and I have received some constructive feedback from various pairing partners. I have to say that I am still getting used to the idea of working with someone else on these challenges. There are definitely times when I feel that we both want to take the code in a different direction or that we are not understanding each other's thought process and would have to explain to each other what we are thinking. This sort of thing can be frustrating at times. On the flip side, there are also times when I feel that having a pairing partner is great because there is someone that I can bounce ideas off of or learn new coding techniques from. It also helps keep me motivated when working on a particularly difficult challenge.

    While I was reading my feedback, I was definitely looking for the constructive criticism because I felt that this would be the most helpful advice to me on how to improve both my technical and cultural skills while at DBC and well into the future. I feel that reading constructive criticism is kind of like removing a bandage from a wound. If you do it slowly and reluctantly it'll be more painful and agonizing, but if you rip it off swiftly, it'll be relatively painless and you'll have benefitted from it in some way.

    I definitely learned a great deal from the feedback that I received from my pairing partners. I feel that some of the most important things for me to work on is to express my thoughts and ideas more clearly and in a concise manner. I need to listen more to other people's ideas when working on a challenge. I also need to speak my thoughts more and speak up when I am not understanding what my pairing partner is doing. I felt that writing feedback is pretty hard because at the same time that I don't want to come off as mean I also want to make sure that I am giving the person I'm writing to something to work on that will help them improve themselves both technically and culturally.  

    Overall, I think that giving and receiving feedback is definitely a good practice and helps both me and my partner improve ourselves as people.
